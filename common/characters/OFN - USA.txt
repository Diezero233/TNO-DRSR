#And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
#And you may find yourself in another part of the world
#And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
#And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
#And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"

#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again after the money's gone
#Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

#And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
#And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
#And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
#And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"

#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again after the money's gone
#Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was

#Water dissolving and water removing
#There is water at the bottom of the ocean
#Under the water, carry the water
#Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean
#Water dissolving and water removing

#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again, into the silent water
#Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again after the money's gone
#Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

#You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
#You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
#And you may ask yourself, "Am I right? Am I wrong?"
#And you may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"

#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again, into the silent water
#Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
#Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
#Into the blue again after the money's gone
#Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Same as it ever was and look where my hand was
#Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
#Letting the days go by, same as it ever was
#Here a twister comes, here comes the twister
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)
#Same as it ever was, same as it ever was (Letting the days go by)
#Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down
#Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
